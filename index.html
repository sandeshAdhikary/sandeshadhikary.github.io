    My research has been focused on quantum-inspired probabilistic models for sequential data. In particular, Iâ€™ve worked on understanding how these models relate to models from classical machine learning in terms of expressiveness and learnability. Currently, I am working on applying some of these models from stochastic processes and tensor networks to the problem of learning parameters of quantum systems from experimental data. Recently, I have also been interested in kernel-based sampling methods, particularly when applied to problems that require sampling over non-Euclidean Riemannian manifolds.
